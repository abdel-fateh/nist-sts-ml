NIST Statistical Test Suite (NIST SP 800-22 Rev. 1a) ported to Matlab.

The original source code and paper can be found here:

The port is not complete nor thoroughly tested. Especially the behavior of some mathematical functions, such as the Incomplete Gamma Integral, has not been verified to work precisely as their counterparts used in the C realization.

Use at your own risk!
